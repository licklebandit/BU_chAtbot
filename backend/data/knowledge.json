In year 2000, the university had student population of 800.\nThere was a need to expand the offerings in various departments especially in the Department of Education.\nAs a result, the following teaching courses were introduced in education: Geography, Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology, Physics, English Language and Literature in English.\nThe School of Social Sciences also expanded to include Development Studies.",
